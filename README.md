This is a wargame made by me in a period of five months. The main objective in this game is to destroy the enemy with minimal casualties of yours. I coded the game in Java without any private libraries except the official ones.

To move an unit: click the hexagon that unit is in, select an unit from the selection panel which is a list of the divisions that are in the hexagon you selected. Then right click to another hexagon. This action will result with the movement of the selected units(The ones with red portrait).

You can do the same action to attack, just right click on an enemy with the selected units this time. This will result with a small scale battle which causes the enemy to lose some soldiers.

Movement points are important, do not forget to check before you move. You can edit, modify and even publish the game if you want to(You have to put my name into creddits).
